        This service is tailored for small to medium smart contract projects, focusing on identifying critical vulnerabilities and improving overall security.  
        While we aim to provide a thorough review, <strong>this is not a formal certification-grade audit</strong> and cannot guarantee detection of every issue.<br /><br />
        If we do not find any critical bugs, you <strong>do not need to pay anything</strong>. This helps us keep things simple, transparent, and trust-based.

        Before sending your project for a full audit, please read the following rules carefully.  
        Failure to meet these criteria may result in project rejection without review.
      </p>

      <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-8 text-gray-400 space-y-2 max-w-2xl">
        <li>
          The project must have a clear and proper <strong>README.md</strong> explaining its purpose and structure.
        </li>
        <li>
          Include information on the smart contract functionality and how many lines of Solidity code it contains.
        </li>
        <li>
          Audits are intended for small to medium projects; your code should be under 2000 lines.
        </li>
        <li>
          Provide a direct link to your code repository (GitHub, GitLab, etc.).
        </li>
        <li>
          Make sure your code is clean and compilable; incomplete or unclear code will be rejected.
        </li>
        <li>
          Do not send projects without following these instructions; such projects will not be reviewed.

        <strong>Note:</strong> Payment for audits is accepted <u>only</u> in stablecoins â€” <em>USDC or USDT</em>.  
        Please be prepared to pay in one of these cryptocurrencies <strong>only if critical bugs are found</strong>.<br /><br />
